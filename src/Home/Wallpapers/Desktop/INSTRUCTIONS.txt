These files are to be placed in your Home folder.

On boot, WallPaper.ZC will replace the system version. THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION. If you want to keep the original, make a copy of it first.
You will need to reboot for the changes to take effect. (So essentially, after placing the files in your Home folder, reboot twice.)

You should inspect the files to see what modifications have been made. 
You could for example, only take in the hotkeys to change the wallpapers but not use the desktop icons.

The hotkeys are:

- Alt+F10
  Previous wallpaper
- Alt+F11
  Next wallpaper
- Alt+F12.
  Yuugure is the "hide/display" for the Sys terminal at the top. 


IMPORTANT:
You NEED to modify /System/Gr/GrScreen.ZC on line 37.
Change else if to if.

U0 GrUpdateTaskWin(CTask *task)
...
		/* else */ if (!(task->win_inhibit & WIF_SELF_DOC))
			DocUpdateTaskDocs(task);

Other changes include opening a stylish user terminal on boot and on icon click.
The top bar is redesigned as well as the term button.
